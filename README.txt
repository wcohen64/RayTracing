Sample photo/current scene drawn:
-2 white point lights

-Plane representing the chess board is drawn with a lighter and darker marble surface with diffuse and blinn-phong shading implemented. 

-Pawn drawn with a cream colored blinn-phong and duffuse shading surface (plastic of some kind). Created from 2 elipsoids and a clipped cone.

-Bishop drawn with a bumpy black glossy surface (procedural normal mapping). Created from 3 elipsoids and a clipped cone and clipped cylinder.

-Queen drawn with a metalic reflective surface (gold). Created with 4 elipsoids, a clipped hyperboliod for the body, and a clipped paraboloid for a crown.

-King drawn with a dielectric surface (glass). Created with 6 elipsoids, a clipped hyperboliod for the body, and a clipped paraboloid for a crown.
